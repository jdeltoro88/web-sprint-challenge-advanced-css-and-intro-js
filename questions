Preprocessing is a more robust syntax for css written in less/sass and compiled w javascript.


Preprocessing seems less crowded and in my head easier to understand. 
Why would I list a bunch of information when I can just compile it in variables to be used again. 

Anything javascript right now is really hard for me. Mathematic operators in specific. 
The syntax is very picky and its hard to see what is going on in some functions.

Variables in less? Or variables in javascript?  They both hold data to be stored and used. i can plug variables
in css to invoke preset styles. 

Functions let developers use a bunch of code by invoking it in a single line. 
We can write the instructions on how to do something that can take up a whole page, a function is all of that page in one command.
